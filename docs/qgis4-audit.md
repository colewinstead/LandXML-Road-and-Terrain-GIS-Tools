# QGIS 4.2.2 / Qt 6 compatibility audit

The initial version 1.5.0 audit ran on a QGIS 4.2.2 macOS runtime. Every plugin Python source at that point was compiled, checked with Ruff (`F,E4,E7,E9`), and imported through QGIS 4.2.2. The provider registered all 11 algorithms; the automated Processing suite exercised vector sinks, profile graph sinks, GeoPackage/OGR, TIN/GeoTIFF, custom report output, and ftUS CRS checks. Later changes in this branch were tested on Windows QGIS 3.44.3; they have not yet been rerun on QGIS 4.2.2.

| File(s) | Finding and action |
| --- | --- |
| `__init__.py`, `landxml_tin_to_geotiff.py`, `provider.py` | Plugin entry and registry APIs load under QGIS 4.2.2. Provider name updated; Inspect registered. No Qt signals/slots or `exec_()` calls. |
| `params.py` | `QgsProcessingParameterNumber.Type.Double` and `setMetadata` initialized successfully under QGIS 4.2.2. No QGIS 4-only parameter class introduced. |
| `compat.py`, `alignment_algorithm.py`, `road_features.py` | Replaced `QVariant`-typed `QgsField` construction with `qgis.PyQt.QtCore.QMetaType.Type`; QGIS 3.44 documents the same constructor. Existing `QgsWkbTypes.Type` and `QgsProcessing.SourceType` names were verified in QGIS 4.2.2. |
| `processing_algorithm.py`, `complete_export.py`, `road_features.py`, `alignment_algorithm.py` | Removed hard-coded EPSG:32636 output and EPSG:4326 source defaults. Explicit source/output CRS choices and unit consistency checks are shared in `processing_common.py`. GDAL/OGR uses selected CRS WKT, permitting custom CRS output where supported. |
| `core.py` | GDAL/OSR transformations use explicit source/output WKT with traditional GIS axis mapping. GeoTIFF projection accepts WKT. Rasterization and triangle topology were exercised under bundled GDAL 3.13.3. No QgsRaster provider/writer API is used. |
| `safe_xml.py`, `landxml/*.py` | XML interpretation is independent of PyQGIS; root-derived namespace handling replaces the fixed LandXML 1.2 URI. Safe expat parser remains in use; no Qt dependency. |
| `inspect_algorithm.py` | Standard Processing file input and optional JSON destination initialized and executed under QGIS 4.2.2. |

Repository-wide scans found **no direct PyQt5/PyQt6 imports, Qt 5 enum spellings, `QVariant` field constructors, `exec_()` calls, or signal/slot code** in active plugin Python. The limited Qt imports are through `qgis.PyQt`. The plugin uses GDAL/OGR for raster and GeoPackage output, not deprecated PyQGIS raster-writer APIs. Geometry constructors and Processing parameter/sink types were exercised by the tests.

Desktop smoke test: QGIS 4.2.2 discovered and enabled the plugin, ran Inspect LandXML on an OpenRoads terrain export, created a TIN GeoTIFF with an explicitly chosen axis swap and ftUS output CRS, and loaded the result over imagery. The GeoTIFF's CRS, pixel size, NoData and populated elevation values were also checked through GDAL. The visual overlay does not establish survey accuracy or the source's undeclared vertical unit. Project files are not included in this branch.

Windows QGIS 3.44.3 subsequently passed 29 parser and headless Processing tests. The suite covers provider unload after QGIS deletes it, partial profile coverage in both 3D centerline outputs, interval-aligned station points, and labeled VPC/VPI/VPT profile controls with vertical exaggeration, grades and K. `processing.runAndLoadResults` loaded labels on both temporary and saved profile outputs. A private OpenRoads road export was exercised through the same tools without committing the source file.

Remaining runtime checks: rerun the updated plugin under QGIS 4.2.2, manually inspect the new profile labels and graphs in both QGIS series, and test custom/project CRSs. Headless and limited desktop execution do not prove survey accuracy or compatibility with every later QGIS 4.x release.
